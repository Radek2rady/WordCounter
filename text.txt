I see you comb your hair, and gimme that grin
It's making me spin now, spinning within
Before I melt like snow, I say hello
How do you do?
I love the way you undress now, baby begin
Do your caress, honey, my heart's in a mess
I love your blue eyed voice, like Tiny Tim shines thru
How do you do?
Well, here we are crackin' jokes in the corner of our mouths
And I feel like I'm laughing in a dream
If I was young I could wait outside your school
'Cause your face is like the cover of a magazine
How do you do (do you do) the things that you do?
No one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do?
Did it ever make sense to you to say bye? (Bye bye)
I see you in that chair with perfect skin
Well, how have you been, baby, livin' in sin?
Hey, I gotta know, did you say hello?
How do you do?
Well, here we are spending time in the louder part of town
And it feels like everything's surreal
When I get old I will wait outside your house
'Cause your hands have got the power meant to heal
How do you do (do you do) the things that you do?
No one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do?
Did it ever make sense to you to say bye? (Bye bye)
Well, here we are, crackin' jokes
How do you do?
Well, here we are spending time
How do you do (do you do) the things that you do?
No one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do?
Did it ever make sense to you to cry bye? (Bye bye)
How do you do (do you do) the things that you do?
No one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do?
Did it ever make sense to you to say bye? (Bye bye)
Yeah, how do you do (do you do) the things you do?
No one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do?
Did it ever make sense to you to say bye? (Bye bye)
